# Call for Papers

******************************************************************
MICCAI SHAPEMI
Workshop on Shape Analysis in Medical Imaging
Granada, Spain, Sep 20th, 2018
https://shapemi.github.io/
******************************************************************

# Description

We gladly announce the workshop for Shape Analysis in Medical Imaging (SHAPEMI, https://shapemi.github.io/) held in conjunction with the conference on MICCAI – Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions, in Granada, Spain, Sep 20th, 2018. 

# Aim and Scope

Shape and geometry processing methods are receiving increased attention, notably, in medical imaging. 

This workshop provide a presentation venue for researchers working in shape and geometrical analysis, such as shape modeling, geometric learning and statistics. This year’s edition also brings a focus on applications. 

Original contributions as well as well as exciting applications in medical imaging are sought in the form of:

* 8-12 page papers 
* 2-3 page abstracts 

Every accepted paper or abstract can include a live demo. 

# Targets topics include, but are not limited to: 
 
* Shape Processing and Analysis
* Shape Learning and Classification
* Geometric Learning and Manifold-based Methods
* Statistics of Shapes and Deformations
* Spectral Shape Analysis
* Spectral Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
* Shape Modeling and Representation
* Shape Segmentation, Registration and Correspondence
* Longitudinal Shape Analysis and Processing
* Medical Applications focused on Shape Analysis
* Evaluation / quality assessment of shape models
* Relevant demos of freely available shape analysis software

# Keynote speakers on the preliminary list include:

* Dr. Michael Bronstein, University of Lugano
* Dr. Daniel Rueckert, Imperial College London
* Dr. Stanley Durrleman, Inria/ICM Aramis Lab
* More to be announced

This workshop will provide an invaluable opportunity for researchers to present recent work on shape analysis in medical imaging. Interactions among fellow researchers will foster a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and will provide insights on medical imaging applications.

Best Paper Award Sponsored by Kitware.
